pipe_flow_different_flow_regimes:

Here we test the ability of the pipe flow model to transition back and forth between different flow regimes.
The pipe is initially dry (there is no water inside the domain). There is a time varying boundary condition on the discharge
on the left wall and an outflow boundary condition on the right wall (i.e. no boundary condition is imposed on the right wall).
The inlet discharge on the left boundary starts from a positive value and decreases linearly to zero, so that the flow inside
the pipe becomes pressurized. Note that at some point there is the coexistence of pressurized and ventilated flow within the
computational domain. Once the inlet discharge has reached the value of zero, it keeps decreasing linearly to a negative value,
hence water starts flowing out of the left boundary. In this way, the pressurized flow existing in the pipe is slowly reverted 
back to ventilated. The test shows that the pipe model has the ability to transition back and forth from ventilated to
pressurized flow. 
NOTE: the bathymetry is zero in this test. Please see pipe_flow_different_flow_regimes_bathymetry for a similar test but with
non-zero bathymetry.

pipe_flow_different_flow_regimes_bathymetry:

This test is similar to pipe_flow_different_flow_regimes except that there is a non-zero bathymetry for the pipe.
