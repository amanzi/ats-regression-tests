# ATS Regression Test Suite


This is the regression test suite for ATS.

The full set of these runs should always work, and should always be run and, if necessary, updated prior to issuing a pull request.


## Quickstart

A basic python environment is needed -- for full details see the ATS python environment installation in the ATS Users Guide (work in progress, link coming!).  In the near term, a python3 installation that includes numpy, matplotlib, and h5py is likely sufficient.

To run the complete set of tests:

```
python regression_tests.py .
```

See also:
```
python regression_tests.py --help
```

## Test design

Developers should strive to include at least one new or modified test for each new process capability added to the code. 

Each test should be kept to under a minute of total runtime, and should prefer to be on a single core.  If tests add a new parallelization aspect, this should be tested with a single (or as few as possible) test(s) on multiple cores.  Recognize that many users develop on laptops with at most two physical cores, so parallel tests should try to stay small and short.  It is preferable to run two tests -- one parallel and extremely short (2-3 time steps even) and a second longer but serial to test -- to one long, parallel test.

Note that new tests are often fragile.  Floating point roundoff issues, compiler differences, and (especially) blas/lapack implementation differences often result in machine-precision level changes in answers.  These changes often cause drift in the final answer, especially if time stepping is adaptive (some timestep takes one more nonlinear iteration, which results in different timestep size records and different answers).  Try to run new tests on multiple machines to ensure that tolerances are reasonable (David Moulton and Ethan Coon can help with this if you do not have access to multiple machines).

## Using the test harness to run the tests

The test harness is built in python3, and requires the h5py package (to load checkpoint files) and numpy, along with a few other built-in packages.  It is distributed as a part of ATS (in [tools/testing/](https://github.com/amanzi/ats/tree/master/tools/testing).  The driving script is distributed in the regression test repository.  Tests can be run in two ways, via ctest and the standard Amanzi build system, or directly in python.

Typically the test harness assumes that the user has set the environmental variables:

    export AMANZI_SRC_DIR=/path/to/amanzi
    export ATS_SRC_DIR=${AMANZI_SRC_DIR}/src/physics/ats

### Download the test repository.

Note that the ats-regression-tests repo is also a submodule of the ATS repo, which itself is a submodule of the Amanzi repo.  Therefore, you get this the first time you install Amanzi via bootstrap, located at:

    $AMANZI_SRC_DIR/src/physics/ats/testing/ats-regression-tests

Alternatively, you can clone it directly:

    git clone https://github.com/amanzi/ats-regression-tests.git

### Run the test suite.

The test suite can be run in two ways.  The first is simply using standard ctest -- the tests are added via cmake in standard Amanzi-ATS configuration.  So after Amanzi-ATS is configured and built via bootstrap, one can simply:

    cd $AMANZI_BUILD_DIR
    make test

Alternatively, the test suite can be run manually in python.  Note that the ats-regression-tests suite is copied into the build directory so that all things are done "out of source."  The result of this is that running through `make test` and running directly in the source directory run _different copies_ of the test suite.  After bootstrap is run, the tests exist both at `$AMANZI_BUILD_DIR/src/physics/ats/testing/ats-regression-tests` and `$AMANZI_SRC_DIR/src/physics/ats/testing/ats-regression-tests`.

To run the test manually:

    cd $AMANZI_SRC_DIR/src/physics/ats/testing/ats-regression-tests
    python regression_tests.py .

Or to run a single test or suite of tests:

    python regression_tests.py 02_richards -t infiltration_fv


## Creating a new test:

* Create and `git add` the xml file to the repo.
* Add the name of the test to a .cfg file in the test's directory, e.g. `02_richards/richards.cfg`
* Make sure that checkpoints are being written at sane times, and add the option, "checkpoint=True" to xml files on evaluators whose results you wish to compare (e.g. saturation_liquid, etc).
* Run the test.  
   * If the test is sensitive to timestep size history (e.g. it is a variable timestep history problem) then use the strategy: `python regression_tests.py -n  --save-dt-history 0X_category/catagory.cfg -t my_test_name`. This runs your test twice -- once to get a sane timestep size history, then parses that, saves it to disk, writes a new input file that uses that exact sequence of step sizes, and runs a second time ensure that the results work with that timestep size history.  This is a huge help for reproducibility and removing false negatives -- the solution can be quite sensitive to timestep size history, but rarely do we want to flag when a non-bitwise repeatable change randomly causes a solver to take one more timestep, thereby changing the answer.
   * If the test can be a fixed timestep size run, then just `python regression_tests.py -n 0X_category/category.cfg -t my_test_name` is sufficient.
   * Finally, after you've added the test, run once more via `python regression_tests.py 0X_category/category.cfg -t my_test_name` (no `-n` this timie) to ensure that tolerances are good and the tests pass with what should be a bitwise identical run.
* Clean out the resulting gold directory: `./clean_gold.sh 0X_category/my_test_name.regression.gold` to make sure that only the checkpoint files and the ats_version.txt files are left.
* Commit and push.


## Updating tests:

* Update xml files, etc
* run the update: `python regression_tests.py -u 0X_category/category.cfg -t "my_test_name"
* clean out the resulting gold directory: `./clean_gold.sh 0X_category/my_test_name.regression.gold` to make sure that only the checkpoint files and the ats_version.txt files are left.
* commit and push

Note that any non-bitwise reproducible result should likely get updated.  It is extremely useful to be able to rely on bitwise reproducibility (when it is available).  So, if changes result in bitwise changes in the solution, prefer to first verify that the tests pass (bitwise deltas should still pass!) and only then update the tests using the above procedure.  This way, if someone else makes a change that shouldn't affect bitwise reproducibility, they can assume safely that they should have it. 

Obviously any changes that cause a test to fail should be checked extensively, confirmed that the change is acceptible (or better), and the document carefully in a commit message why the solution changed.
